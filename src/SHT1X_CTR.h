/*
* SHT1x Expanded Library by jnfaria
*  Based in the library created by Sparkfun.
*
* Based on previous work by:
*	 Jonathan Oxer: <www.practicalarduino.com>
*    Maurice Ribble: <www.glacialwanderer.com/hobbyrobotics/?p=5>
*    Wayne ?: <ragingreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/ardunio-and-sht15.html>
*
* Updated for Arduino 1.6.8 Library Manager  
* August 3, 2017
*
*
* Summary:
*	Manages communication with SHT1x series (SHT10, SHT11, SHT15) temperature / humidity sensors 
*	from Sensirion, supporting both V3 and V4 versions. (www.sensirion.com).
*
* Notes:
*	This library is an expansion of the SHT1x controller provided by Sparkfun. Providing advanced functionlality of the SHT1x module by taping into the  
*	sensor's status register, you can select measurement resolution (supporting 8/12/14 bits data measurements) for increased precision or speed.
*	It also contains an optional CRC-8 checksum calculation to verify data integrity. (See "Notes" to find out how to disable this feature)
*
*	Using preprocessor directives, you can disable some non-essencial procedures to achieve better performance (extra free space / faster processing):
*		- SHT1X_USE_BITWISE_CRC : Changes CRC-8 checksum calculation from a bytewise process (using a lookup table) to a bitwise (slower but frees up some space);
*		- SHT1X_NO_CRC_CHECK : Disables the CRC-8 checksum calculation within the data measurements;
*		- SHT1X_NO_SAFEGUARD : Disables SHT1X overheat safeguard procedures (removes all restrictions from measurement times, but can damage the sensor in long-term usage);
*
